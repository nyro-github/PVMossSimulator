### üß† Project Overview

This simulator was developed as part of the **Net-Zero Campus (4CBLW00-07)** course at TU/e. Our assignment was to design a scenario that could contribute to making the university energy neutral by 2030.  
Our group proposed a **double fa√ßade** system that combines **photovoltaic (PV) windows** with **moss-based bioenergy**, leveraging both solar and biological processes to generate sustainable energy. According to our calculations, this hybrid system could potentially supply **over 20% of the university‚Äôs energy demand**.

### üßë‚Äçüíª About This Application

I designed and built this entire application from scratch to simulate and test various configurations of the proposed fa√ßade system.  
From the initial UI design and architectural setup to backend logic, input validation, and feature integration, everything was implemented by me. The only input I received was some help choosing realistic parameter ranges.

The result is a modular, interactive Java-based simulator that allows users to customize environmental conditions, toggle system components, and view estimated energy output over a 24-hour period.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Modern User Interface**  
  Clean, Windows-style layout with distinct panels for PV windows, moss systems, and results.
  
- **Manual Input Controls**  
  All values (like angle, area, humidity, etc.) can be adjusted via labeled text fields for precise control.

- **Scenario Presets**  
  Quickly test with predefined conditions (e.g. sunny, cloudy, high humidity).

- **Enable/Disable Systems**  
  Users can toggle PV or moss modules independently to test different fa√ßade setups.

- **Validation & Feedback**  
  Inputs are validated live ‚Äî incorrect entries are flagged and reset automatically.

- **Reset & Info Buttons**  
  Easily revert to default values or check an explanation of the parameters and units.
