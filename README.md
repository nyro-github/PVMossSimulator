## 🌱 Project Overview

This simulation tool models the daily energy contribution of a **double-skin façade** design combining:
- **Photovoltaic (PV) windows** on the outer layer
- A **moss-based bio façade** on the inner layer

The purpose of the app is to estimate the total energy that can be captured over 24 hours from both subsystems, under different environmental conditions. The simulation supports real-time input adjustment, visual feedback, and is intended as a decision-support tool for evaluating **Net-Zero architecture**.

This project was developed as part of the **CBL: Net Zero TU/e Campus 2030** course at Eindhoven University of Technology.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Dynamic GUI** built with Java Swing  
- Modular backend structure (`parameters`, `output`, `gui`)
- Adjustable environmental factors:
  - Sun level
  - Cloud coverage
  - Temperature
  - Façade area
  - PV angle
  - Moss moisture and humidity
- **Preset scenarios** like "Spring Morning with Clear Skies" or "Cloudy Winter Morning"
- Real-time computation of:
  - Solar energy input
  - Energy captured by PV windows
  - Energy generated by the moss layer
  - Status of moss (Dormant → Thriving)
  - Total energy output
- Units auto-adjusted (e.g. Wh for moss, kWh for PV)

## 🔬 Scientific Scope

This simulator uses physics- and biology-inspired models:

### PV Energy Model
Based on:
- Peak irradiance: 1000 W/m²
- Cosine law for angle of incidence
- Temperature derating (–0.4%/°C above 25°C)
- Cloud reduction factor
- PV efficiency: 10%

### Moss Energy Model
Estimates energy via:
- Biomass growth rate (g/m²/day)
- Moisture & humidity impact
- Temperature effect
- Conversion rate: 1g biomass ≈ 0.005 kWh

These estimates provide a **realistic but conservative approximation** of what a nature-integrated façade might contribute to sustainable campus design.

## 🧑‍💻 Development Notes

This simulator was **entirely developed by Alexandru Batog** as the main technical deliverable in the project group. The app was built from scratch, including:
- GUI layout and interaction logic
- Back-end simulation logic
- Integration of all parameter mappings
- Scenario-based presets system
- Dynamic energy and status calculations

All source code is structured for maintainability and extensibility.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Java 21** installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Compile and run the `MainFrame.java` file inside the `gui` package using your preferred IDE or build tool.
