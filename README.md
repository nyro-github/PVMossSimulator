### 🧠 Project Overview

This simulator was developed as part of the **Net-Zero Campus (4CBLW00-07)** course at TU/e. Our assignment was to design a scenario that could contribute to making the university energy neutral by 2030.  
Our group proposed a **double façade** system that combines **photovoltaic (PV) windows** with **moss-based bioenergy**, leveraging both solar and biological processes to generate sustainable energy. According to our calculations, this hybrid system could potentially supply **over 20% of the university’s energy demand**.

### 🧑‍💻 About This Application

I designed and built this entire application from scratch to simulate and test various configurations of the proposed façade system.  
From the initial UI design and architectural setup to backend logic, input validation, and feature integration, everything was implemented by me, being helped by the team only with which parameters to use and which presets to consider.

The result is a modular, interactive Java-based simulator that allows users to customize environmental conditions, toggle system components, and view estimated energy output over a 24-hour period.

### ⚙️ Key Features

- **Modern User Interface**  
  Clean, Windows-style layout with distinct panels for PV windows, moss systems, and results.
  
- **Manual Input Controls**  
  All values (like angle, area, humidity, etc.) can be adjusted via labeled text fields for precise control.

- **Scenario Presets**  
  Quickly test with predefined conditions (e.g. sunny, cloudy, high humidity).

- **Enable/Disable Systems**  
  Users can toggle PV or moss modules independently to test different façade setups.

- **Validation & Feedback**  
  Inputs are validated live — incorrect entries are flagged and reset automatically.

- **Reset & Info Buttons**  
  Easily revert to default values or check an explanation of the parameters and units.

### 🧱 Factor Design

The simulation is backed by an abstract class model where each environmental or physical factor inherits from a common base class:
